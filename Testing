Edit Resources: (Donald)
      To test the functionality of the module, I first went to the 'Resources' tab of HelpMeHelpYou and added a resource using the 'Add Resources'.
      I gave the resource a resource id of '9485', resource type of 'electronic', and quantity of '1'.
      After adding the resource I went to 'Edit Resources' in the 'Resources' tab. I input the resource id '9485' so that I would be able to edit the resource with that same resource id then I changed the resource type to 'phone' and kept the resource qty as '1'.
      After typing all of the information into its correct input boxes, I pressed the 'Edit' button.
      After doing this the resource reprinted with the changes made to the resource.
